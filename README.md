# Feature_Extraction_of_Human_Faces
Image files are processed in batches from the 'a' directory, with each image undergoing facial analysis and emotion recognition using the DeepFace library. The results of this analysis are then consolidated and stored in a CSV file.

## Usage
* Create a folder named 'a' in google colab and upload 100 images of human females and 100 images of human males in 'a'.
* Run the code and download the 'result.csv' file created, which contains the features extracted from these 200 images.
